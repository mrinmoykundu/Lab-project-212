# Project Schrodinger

This is a course project based on the knowledge from Course EEE-212, BUET on nuemical analysis using Matlab.

Project supervisor was Rajat Chakraborty.

The objective of the project was to find a naive numerical solution of the wave function and the probability distribution of a quantum particle (namely electron) subjected to a set of of potential field selected in GUI. 
  
  Square Potential well
	Harmonic Oscillator
	Linear Potential Well
	Culumbo's Potential
	Double Infinite Well
	Poschl Teller Potential
	Morse Potential
	Lennard Jones Potential

 The solution and graphs shown here are for one dimensional situation. A playground mode was also added to provide custom potential field.
